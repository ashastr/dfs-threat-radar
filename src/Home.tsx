        Gathering all types of vulnerabilities in one place is a fundamental
        practice for any organization serious about cybersecurity. It enhances
        visibility, improves efficiency, and ultimately strengthens the overall
        security posture, safeguarding the organization against the ever-present
        threat of cyber attacks.
